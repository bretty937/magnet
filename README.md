## Abstract  


**Magnet** is Purple-team telemetry & simulation toolkit.  
**Purpose:** modular, cross-platform (eventually) generator for telemetry and malicious activity.  
> Why the name?    
> Because this attracts SOC analysts and detection rules! 😜   


As a secondary use case, Magnet can also be used as a decoy during red team engagements, in order to generate false positives noise and distract defenders 😈    
From an architectural standpoint, Magnet is modular, allowing you to create as many modules as you like and modify existing ones without necessarily affecting the others.  


> [!CAUTION]  
> The project is still in its early stages of development and may contain bugs: **contributions are very welcome!**  
> The tool is best suited for on-the-fly demonstration/detection testing and does not replace fully fledged purple-team exercises conducted by experienced red teamers.   


## Ok, but why?  
What better way to assess the utility of this tool than by directly examining one of its modules?  
Consider, for example, the [*Ransomware Simulation for Windows*](./src/platforms/windows/actions/ransomware_sim.rs) action:   
it generates thousands of files and encrypts them, attempts to delete shadow copies with older timestamps, and finally places a ransom note on the desktop.    
This module demonstrates its value for testing detection rules and behavioral analytics specifically designed to identify ransomware activity.  


## Quickstart

Donwload the [*release*](https://github.com/r3drun3/magnet/releases/) from github, for example:  
```bash
curl -L -o magnet.zip https://github.com/R3DRUN3/magnet/releases/download/v0.4.0/magnet-v0.4.0-windows-x86_64.zip
```  
Extract the archive and you are ready to go!  



or compile locally:  

For Windows: 
```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
```  



For Linux: 
```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
``` 


Each binary only includes the modules for that platform.  

> [!WARNING]  
> First compilation may take some minutes.  

## Modules

list modules
```bash
magnet list
``` 

Run all windows modules:  
```bash
magnet run windows all
```   

Run some of the windows modules:  
```bash
magnet run windows discovery_sim ransomware_sim high_cpu_miner_sim
```  

> [!CAUTION]  
> **Some modules require administrative privileges to run**.  
> Magnet prioritizes non-intrusive modules that only aim to simulate suspicious or malicious activity but some of the modules may still be detected by EDRs:       
> **USE WITH CAUTION AND RUN ONLY ON AUTHORIZED SYSTEMS !!**  

> [!TIP]
> In order to add a module/action, follow these instructions:    
> - write the module inside the parent OS folder, for example [*here*](./src/platforms/windows/actions/) are all the windows ones.  
> - add the module in [*mod.rs*](./src/platforms/windows/actions/mod.rs).  
> - register the runner in [*main.rs*](./src/main.rs).  
> **For seamless integration, make sure new modules follow signatures and contracts of existing ones**  





## activity logs  
For each execution, Magnet writes detailed activity logs (in various formats) to
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MagnetTelemetry`.  
Activity artifacts may also be created in that directory or in other locations, depending on the module:  
for example, in the ransomware simulation, the encrypted files are stored in the `MagnetTelemetry` folder, while the ransom note is placed on the user's `Desktop`.    

## tests  
Some modules already implement unit testing, for example:  
```bash
cargo test --test ransom_note_test
```
