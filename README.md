## Abstract  


**Magnet** is Purple-team telemetry & simulation toolkit.  
**Purpose:** modular, cross-platform (eventually) generator for telemetry and malicious activity.  
> Why the name?    
> Because this attracts SOC analysts and detection rules! 😜   


As a secondary use case, Magnet can also be used as a decoy during red team engagements, in order to generate false positives noise and distract defenders.  
From an architectural standpoint, Magnet is modular, allowing you to create as many modules as you like and modify existing ones without necessarily affecting the others.  


> [!CAUTION]  
> The project is still in its early stages of development and may contain bugs: **contributions are very welcome!**  
> The tool is best suited for on-the-fly demonstration/detection testing and does not replace fully fledged purple-team exercises conducted by experienced red teamers.   


## Ok, but why?  
What better way to assess the utility of this tool than by directly examining one of its modules?  
Consider, for example, the [*Ransomware Simulation for Windows*](./src/platforms/windows/actions/ransomware_sim.rs) action:   
it generates thousands of files and encrypts them, attempts to delete shadow copies with older timestamps, and finally places a ransom note on the desktop.    
This module demonstrates its value for testing detection rules and behavioral analytics specifically designed to identify ransomware activity.  


## Quickstart

Compile:

For Windows: 
```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
```  



For Linux: 
```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
``` 


Each binary only includes the modules for that platform.  

> [!WARNING]  
> First compilation may take some minutes.  

## Modules

list modules
```bash
magnet list
``` 

Run all windows modules:  
```bash
magnet run windows all
```   

Run some of the windows modules:  
```bash
magnet run windows discovery_sim ransomware_sim high_cpu_miner_sim
```  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Magnet prioritizes non-intrusive modules that only aim to simulate suspicious or malicious activity but some of the modules may still be detected by EDRs:       
> **USE WITH CAUTION AND RUN ONLY ON AUTHORIZED SYSTEMS !!**  


### Write new modules
In order to add a module/action, follow these instructions:  
- write the module inside the parent OS folder, for example [*here*](./src/platforms/windows/actions/) are all the windows ones.
- add the module in [*mod.rs*](./src/platforms/windows/actions/mod.rs).
- register the runner in [*main.rs*](./src/main.rs).  




## activity logs  
For each execution, Magnet writes detailed activity logs (in various formats) to
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MagnetTelemetry`.  
Activity artifacts may also be created in that directory or in other locations, depending on the module:  
for example, in the ransomware simulation, the encrypted files are stored in the `MagnetTelemetry` folder, while the ransom note is placed on the user's `Desktop`.    

## tests  
Some modules already implement unit testing, for example:  
```bash
cargo test --test ransom_note_test
```
